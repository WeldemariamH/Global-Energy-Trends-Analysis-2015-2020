###### Global Energy Trends Analysis (2015-2020)

### Overview
This repository contains data, code, and analyses related to a comprehensive study on global energy trends from 2015 to 2020. The project involves data exploration, cleaning, preprocessing in Python, as well as visualization and analysis in Power BI.

### Files Included
1. `Country_data.csv` - Contains detailed geographical information countries including thier continent,subcontinent and area in square kilometers.
2. 'renewable_electricity_by_country.csv` - data focusing specifically on renewable electricity production by country like renewable percentage both in 2015 and 2020,the total electricity generated,renewable and non-hydro renewable energy.
3. `Data_Exploration_Cleaning_Preprocessing.py` - Python script that covers data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing tasks. This includes plotting line charts for column distributions, creating new columns, and merging parental data.
4. `merged_data.csv` - Merged dataset after preprocessing, combining relevant columns for further analysis.
5. 'powerbi_report.pbix` - Power BI file containing three insightful pages of analysis.
